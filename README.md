# BeLink

Final project after fullstack course. The project is a collaboration of a team of five programmers. Gilad Lev Sagi Barbi Ruby Gorgi and Rani Lang. After researching and understanding that the world of recruiting for companies requires a lot of effort and prevents many people from exposing themselves even though they are coordinating. That's why we decided to build BELINK, an application that enables a connection between a company and a potential employee. The matching process is carried out on the basis of an initial questionnaire, after which we weigh the questions and run them in a matching algorithm that we built. If there is a match, we send the recruit an invitation to contact and start a chat.
